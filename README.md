# Job Seeker App

This app is just prototype of my real project(soon, if i got a stable internet connection). Datas is saved to localStorage. Can run offline without backend 💪
Perharps you want to review my code or use it as your school assignment in the future.

## Advantage

- No Copyright
- Free to use/review/modify
- PR is welcomed (so that i can learn from you too 😅)

## Disadvantage

- Using localStorage to store the data (so don't expect a super safe security 😁)
- Build with Vue-3 (BETA version) which is i'm not really feel confortable for some bugs/glitches.
- In this app i just wanna dive into the bussiness logic and will fix the UI soon.
- I'm not using router in some important routes instead of using tab. (which is not good)

## Dependencies

- vue-router@next
- vuex@next
